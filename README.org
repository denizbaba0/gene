#+title: GENE

* WARNING
All of that is on my head. (I'm sorry) I didn't implement almost nothing yet.

#+begin_quote
Cross-Universe Package Manager that has the ability to reconcile anything
#+end_quote

* Manifest
GENE is a plan as a generic package manager.

** Configuration
GENE is configured with =gene.toml= on your project root.

#+begin_src toml
[rust.c]
backend = "vcpkg"
interface = "cbindgen"
deps = [
     "glfw",
]
#+end_src

** Language Package Managers


# * Manifest
# Package management is too specific. You have at least a dozen package managers for your system to be /usable/.
# Maybe you don't know the name of your package or It fails to build etc.


# #+begin_export ascii
# Naive list of package stereotypes:
# - Language  Package  Manager (LPM)
# - System    Package  Manager (SPM)
# - Project Dependency Manager (PDM)
# #+end_export

# GENE targets LPM issues:

# # ** System Package Managers

# # NOTE: This will be another concept (unix philosophy)

# # #+begin_quote
# # apt, pacman, yum, nix, homebrew, choco, scoop, rpm, zypperâ€¦
# # #+end_quote

# # Although they are good at how they're installing packages (especially some of them) It doesn't fix the issue of stardalization.

# # With GENE, you will have a standard way of installing package in an unambiguous way.
